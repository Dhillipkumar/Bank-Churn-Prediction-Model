# Bank-Churn-Prediction-Model

Description
Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn in banks using a comprehensive dataset. This project aims to help banks identify key factors influencing customer churn and achieve high prediction accuracy. By understanding and predicting customer churn, banks can take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

The study evaluates various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting, to identify the most effective model for churn prediction. Rigorous data exploration and feature engineering techniques are employed to investigate the relationships between different customer attributes, such as demographics, account information, transaction history, and their impact on churn.

The results indicate that the random forest algorithm outperforms other techniques, achieving a high prediction accuracy. This superior performance can be attributed to the ensemble nature of random forest, which effectively captures complex patterns and relationships within the dataset. The trained model is then deployed into a user-friendly web application using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and PyCharm, an integrated development environment (IDE). This application allows users to input customer data through an intuitive interface and generates accurate churn predictions in real-time.

This deployment approach not only showcases the practical applicability of the developed model but also facilitates its integration into real-world banking workflows. Banks can leverage this application to streamline customer retention strategies, enabling efficient and informed decision-making regarding customer engagement and retention efforts.

The study highlights the potential of machine learning techniques, particularly random forest, in accurately predicting customer churn, offering a valuable tool for banks to enhance their customer retention strategies. The successful deployment of the model through a user-friendly web application further demonstrates its practical utility and paves the way for its widespread adoption in the banking sector.
